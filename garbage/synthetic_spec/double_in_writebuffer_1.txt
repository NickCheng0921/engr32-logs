## Specification for `Dual-Input Writeback Buffer`

## Interfaces
### System Components
- **Clock/Reset**
  - `sc_in<bool> sys_clk`
  - `sc_in<bool> rst_n`

### Channels
- `Connections::In<WBReq> wb_req1_i`
- `Connections::In<WBReq> wb_req2_i`
- `Connections::Out<MemReq> mem_o`

## High Level Operation
- Two separate input sources write requests to the buffer.
- Requests sent to buffer depend on combination of values from input sources.
    - combination logic can be found in Data Combination Logic section

## Data Combination Logic
- Extract top and bottom halves of each input.
- Combine lower half of input wb_req1_i with upper half of wb_req2_i.
- Result is XORed with a constant bit pattern for obfuscation/sanitization.
    - bit pattern for XOR is 0xDEADBEEF

## Struct and Constant Definitions
```SystemC
struct WBReq {
    ac_int<32, false> data;
};

struct MemReq {
    ac_int<32, false> data;
};
```
